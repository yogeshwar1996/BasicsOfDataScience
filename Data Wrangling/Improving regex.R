converted[!index]    # show problems

# Four clear patterns of entries have arisen along with some other minor problems:
#   
#   Many students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches. For example, 6' - our pattern requires that inches be included.
#   Some students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet entered just that number.
#   Some of the inches were entered with decimal points. For example 5'7.5''. Our pattern only looks for two digits.
#   Some entires have spaces at the end, for example 5 ' 9.
#   Some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals: 1.6, 1,7.
#   Two students added cm.
#   One student spelled out the numbers: Five foot eight inches.

# Case 1
# 
# For case 1, if we add a '0 to, for example, convert all 6 to 6'0, then our pattern will match. This can be done using groups using the following code:
#   
yes <- c("5", "6", "5")
no <- c("5'", "5''", "5'4")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([4-7])$", "\\1'0")

# The pattern says it has to start (^), be followed with a digit between 4 and 7, and then end there ($). The parenthesis defines the group that we pass as \\1 to the replace regex.

# Cases 2 and 4
# We can adapt this code slightly to handle case 2 as well which covers the entry 5'. Note that the 5' is left untouched by the code above. This is because the extra ' makes the pattern not match since we have to end with a 5 or 6. To handle case 2, we want to permit the 5 or 6 to be followed by no or one symbol for feet. So we can simply add '{0,1} after the ' to do this. We can also use the none or once special character ?. As we saw previously, this is different from * which is none or more. We now see that this code also handles the fourth case as well:

str_replace(s, "^([56])'?$", "\\1'0")

# Note that here we only permit 5 and 6 but not 4 and 7. This is because heights of exactly 5 and exactly 6 feet tall are quite common, so we assume those that typed 5 or 6 really meant either 60 or 72 inches. However, heights of exactly 4 or exactly 7 feet tall are so rare that, although we accept 84 as a valid entry, we assume that a 7 was entered in error.


# Case 3
# We can use quantifiers to deal with  case 3. These entries are not matched because the inches include decimals and our pattern does not permit this. We need allow the second group to include decimals and not just digits. This means we must permit zero or one period . followed by zero or more digits. So we will use both ? and *. Also remember that for this particular case, the period needs to be escaped since it is a special character (it means any character except a line break).
# So we can adapt our pattern, currently ^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$, to permit a decimal at the end:
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"


# Case 5, meters using commas, we can approach similarly to how we converted the x.y to x'y. A difference is that we require that the first digit is 1 or 2:

yes <- c("1,7", "1, 8", "2, " )
no <- c("5,8", "5,3,2", "1.7")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2")


# Trimming

# In general, spaces at the start or end of the string are uninformative. These can be particularly deceptive because sometimes they can be hard to see:

s <- "Hi "
cat(s)
identical(s, "Hi")
# This is a general enough problem that there is a function dedicated to removing them: str_trim.
str_trim("5 ' 9 ")


# To upper and to lower case
# One of the entries writes out numbers as words: Five foot eight inches. Although not efficient, we could add 12 extra str_replace to convert zero to 0, one to 1, and so on. To avoid having to write two separate operations for Zero and zero, One and one, etc., we can use the str_to_lower() function to make all words lower case first:
s <- c("Five feet eight inches")
str_to_lower(s)


# Putting it into a function

convert_format <- function(s){
  s %>%
    str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '
    str_replace_all("inches|in|''|\"|cm|and", "") %>%  #remove inches and other symbols
    str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") %>% #change x.y, x,y x y
    str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") %>% #add 0 when to 5 or 6
    str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2") %>% #change european decimal
    str_trim() #remove extra space
}


# We are now ready to define a procedure that handles converting all the problematic cases.

convert_format <- function(s){
  s %>%
    str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '
    str_replace_all("inches|in|''|\"|cm|and", "") %>%  #remove inches and other symbols
    str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") %>% #change x.y, x,y x y
    str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") %>% #add 0 when to 5 or 6
    str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2") %>% #change european decimal
    str_trim() #remove extra space
}
# We can also write a function that converts words to numbers:

words_to_numbers <- function(s){
  str_to_lower(s) %>%  
    str_replace_all("zero", "0") %>%
    str_replace_all("one", "1") %>%
    str_replace_all("two", "2") %>%
    str_replace_all("three", "3") %>%
    str_replace_all("four", "4") %>%
    str_replace_all("five", "5") %>%
    str_replace_all("six", "6") %>%
    str_replace_all("seven", "7") %>%
    str_replace_all("eight", "8") %>%
    str_replace_all("nine", "9") %>%
    str_replace_all("ten", "10") %>%
    str_replace_all("eleven", "11")
}


converted <- problems %>% words_to_numbers %>% convert_format
remaining_problems <- converted[not_inches_or_cm(converted)]
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d+\\.?\\d*$"

# We are now ready to put everything we've done so far together and wrangle our reported heights data as we try to recover as many heights as possible. The code is complex but we will break it down into parts.
# 
# We start by cleaning up the height column so that the heights are closer to a feet'inches format. We added an original heights column so we can compare before and after.
# 
# Let's start by writing a function that cleans up strings so that all the feet and inches formats use the same x'y format when appropriate.
