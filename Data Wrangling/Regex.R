# 
# A regular expression (regex) is a way to describe a specific pattern of characters of text. A set of rules has been designed to do this specifically and efficiently.
# stringr functions can take a regex as a pattern.
# str_detect() indicates whether a pattern is present in a string.
# The main difference between a regex and a regular string is that a regex can include special characters.
# The | symbol inside a regex means "or".
# Use '\\d' to represent digits. The backlash is used to distinguish it from the character 'd'. In R, you must use two backslashes for digits in regular expressions; in some other languages, you will only use one backslash for regex special characters.
# str_view() highlights the first occurrence of a pattern, and the str_view_all() function highlights all occurrences of the pattern.
# load stringr through tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# detect whether a comma is present
pattern <- ","
str_detect(murders_raw$total, pattern) 

# show the subset of strings including "cm"
str_subset(reported_heights$height, "cm")

# use the "or" symbol inside a regex (|)
yes <- c("180 cm", "70 inches")
no <- c("180", "70''")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_detect(s, "cm") | str_detect(s, "inches")
str_detect(s, "cm|inches")

# highlight the first occurrence of a pattern
str_view(s, pattern)

# highlight all instances of a pattern
str_view_all(s, pattern)
