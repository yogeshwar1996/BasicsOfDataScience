# 
# In the raw heights data, many students did not report their height as the number of inches as requested. There are many entries with real height information but in the wrong format, which we can extract with string processing. 
# When there are both text and numeric entries in a column, the column will be a character vector. Converting this column to numeric will result in NAs for some entries.
# To correct problematic entries, look for patterns that are shared across large numbers of entries, then define rules that identify those patterns and use these rules to write string processing tasks.
# Use suppressWarnings() to hide warning messages for a function.
# load raw heights data and inspect
