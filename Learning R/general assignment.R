#The olive dataset in dslabs contains composition in percentage of eight fatty acids
#found in the lipid fraction of 572 Italian olive oils:
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
data(olive)
head(olive)
nrow(olive)
#Plot the percent palmitic acid versus palmitoleic acid in a scatterplot. What relationship do you see?
plot(olive$palmitic, olive$palmitoleic)
#inference - There is a positive linear relationship between palmitic and palmitoleic.

#Create a histogram of the percentage of eicosenoic acid in olive.
hist(olive$eicosenoic)
#inference - The most common value of eicosenoic acid is below 0.05%.

#Make a boxplot of palmitic acid percentage in olive with separate distributions for each region
boxplot(olive$palmitic~olive$region)
boxplot(palmitic~region, data=olive)
#Region is maximum median and max variation
#Inference Southern Italy
