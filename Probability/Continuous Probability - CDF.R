# The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a distribution function for continuous data x
# that reports the proportion of the data below a for all values of a:
# F(a)=Pr(x≤a)
# The CDF is the probability distribution function for continuous variables. 
# For example, to determine the probability that a male student is taller than 70.5 inches 
# given a vector of male heights x, we can use the CDF:
# Pr(x>70.5)=1−Pr(x≤70.5)=1−F(70.5)
# The probability that an observation is in between two values a,b is F(b)−F(a).

data(heights)
View(heights)
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% pull(height)

# Given a vector x, we can define a function for computing the CDF of x using:
F <- function(a) {
  mean(x <= a)
  }
1 - F(70)    # probability of male taller than 70 inches
