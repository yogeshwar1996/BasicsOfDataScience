# The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a distribution function for continuous data x that reports the proportion of the data below a for all values of a:
  # F(a)=Pr(x≤a)
# The CDF is the probability distribution function for continuous variables. 
# For example, to determine the probability that a male student is taller than 70.5 inches 
# given a vector of male heights x, we can use the CDF:
    # Pr(x>70.5)=1−Pr(x≤70.5)=1−F(70.5)
# The probability that an observation is in between two values a,b is F(b)−F(a).
