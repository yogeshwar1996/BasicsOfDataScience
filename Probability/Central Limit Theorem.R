# The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says that the distribution of the sum of a random variable
# is approximated by a normal distribution.

# The expected value of a random variable,  E[X]=Î¼ ,
# is the average of the values in the urn. This represents the expectation of one draw.

# The standard error of one draw of a random variable is the standard deviation of the values in the urn

# The expected value of the sum of draws is the number of draws times the expected value of the random variable.
