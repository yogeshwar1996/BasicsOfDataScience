# The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says that the distribution of the sum of a random variable
# is approximated by a normal distribution.

# The expected value of a random variable,  E[X]=μ ,
# is the average of the values in the urn. This represents the expectation of one draw.

# The standard error of one draw of a random variable is the standard deviation of the values in the urn

# The expected value of the sum of draws is the number of draws times the expected value of the random variable. 
# 
# Key points
# Random variable times a constant
# The expected value of a random variable multiplied by a constant is that constant times its original expected value:
#   
#   E[aX]=aμ 
# The standard error of a random variable multiplied by a constant is that constant times its original standard error:
#   
#   SE[aX]=aσ 
# Average of multiple draws of a random variable
# The expected value of the average of multiple draws from an urn is the expected value of the urn ( μ ).
# 
# The standard deviation of the average of multiple draws from an urn is the standard deviation of the urn divided by the square root of the number of draws ( σ/n−−√ ).
# 
# The sum of multiple draws of a random variable
# The expected value of the sum of  n  draws of a random variable is  n  times its original expected value:
#   
#   E[nX]=nμ 
# The standard error of the sum of  n  draws of random variable is  n−−√  times its original standard error:
#   
#   SE[nX]=n−−√σ 
# 
# The sum of multiple different random variables
# The expected value of the sum of different random variables is the sum of the individual expected values for each random variable:
#   
#   E[X1+X2+⋯+Xn]=μ1+μ2+⋯+μn 
# The standard error of the sum of different random variables is the square root of the sum of squares of the individual standard errors:
#   
#   SE[X1+X2+⋯+Xn]=σ21+σ22+⋯+σ2n−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√ 
# Transformation of random variables
# If  X  is a normally distributed random variable and  a  and  b  are non-random constants, then  aX+b  is also a normally distributed random variable.
