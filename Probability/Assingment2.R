# Two teams, say the Cavs and the Warriors, are playing a seven game championship series. The first to win four games wins the series. The teams are equally good, so they each have a 50-50 chance of winning each game.
# If the Cavs lose the first game, what is the probability that they win the series?
# Assign a variable 'n' as the number of remaining games.
n = 6

# Assign a variable `outcomes` as a vector of possible game outcomes, where 0 indicates a loss and 1 indicates a win for the Cavs.
outcomes = c(loss=0, win=1)

# Assign a variable `l` to a list of all possible outcomes in all remaining games. Use the `rep` function on `list(outcomes)` to create list of length `n`.
l = rep(list(outcomes), n)


# Create a data frame named 'possibilities' that contains all combinations of possible outcomes for the remaining games.
possibilities = expand.grid(l)

# Create a vector named 'results' that indicates whether each row in the data frame 'possibilities' contains enough wins for the Cavs to win the series.
results = rowSums(possibilities)>=4
# Calculate the proportion of 'results' in which the Cavs win the series. Print the outcome to the console.

mean(results)


# Confirm the results of the previous question with a Monte Carlo simulation 
# to estimate the probability of the Cavs winning the series after losing the first game.
